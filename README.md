## Data Structures and Algorithms Course Overview

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms, essential for designing efficient software that can manage and process data effectively. Here are the key components of the course:

1. **Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures**: The course begins with the basics of algorithmic thinking, covering how data can be efficiently accessed, searched, and manipulated.

2. **Complexity Analysis**: Students learn to evaluate the performance of algorithms, focusing on time and space complexity. This helps in understanding the efficiency of different algorithms under various conditions.

3. **Core Data Structures**: The course covers a variety of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees. Each structure is explored in detail, including its implementation and applications.

4. **Algorithm Design Techniques**: Students explore several methods for creating algorithms, including recursive algorithms, divide and conquer strategies, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming.

5. **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Essential algorithms for sorting data (like quicksort and mergesort) and searching data (such as binary search) are discussed.

6. **Graph Algorithms**: Advanced topics include the study of graph representations, and algorithms for traversing, searching, and finding the shortest path in graphs.

7. **Practical Implementations**: Throughout the course, students implement various algorithms and data structures in Java, providing a practical foundation in programming alongside theoretical learning.

8. **Textbook and Resources**: The course extensively uses "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, ensuring that students have access to in-depth material on each topic.

The course assessment includes written exams and practical coding tests, aimed at evaluating both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in implementing data structures and algorithms.
